Interactive Tableau Dashboard: IBM Employee Attrition Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores the IBM Analytics sample dataset to uncover key insights about employee attrition. 
Using Tableau, I built an interactive dashboard that visualizes how different factors — such as job role, distance from home, education level, and monthly income — influence an employee's likelihood to leave the company.

## 🧠 Key Questions Explored
- How does attrition vary by job role and distance from home?
- What is the relationship between education and monthly income?
- Are there patterns in attrition based on age, gender, or years at the company?

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Tableau (for data visualization)
- MS Excel 
- IBM sample dataset (fictional HR data) --> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/employee

## 📁 Files
- `ibm_employee_attrition_dashboard.twbx` — Tableau dashboard file
- `/images/` — screenshots of the dashboard
- `README.md` — project summary and insights

## 📌 Insights
- Job roles such as Sales Representative show higher attrition rates
- Employees with longer distances from home tend to leave more often
- Higher education level does not always guarantee higher income
